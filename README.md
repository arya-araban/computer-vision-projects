# Computer vision projects

These are the projects which I completed for the Computer Vision course of Ferdowsi university. This course was presented in winter of 2020 

The project details are in the root pdf, and solutions are in the `my solutions` folder. These projects include function implementations for Furier, filter convolution, wavelet, as well as other algorithms.  All of the projects were coded using Matlab
